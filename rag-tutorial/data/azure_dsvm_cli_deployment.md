# Data Science VMs in Azure

## Overview

Azure Data Science Virtual Machines (DSVM) are specially configured virtual machines on the Azure cloud that come pre-installed with a wide range of popular data science tools, libraries, and frameworks. They are designed to simplify the process of data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning projects by providing a robust, out-of-the-box environment for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI researchers.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Pre-Configured Environment

Azure DSVMs come pre-installed with popular data science tools such as:

- Python, R, and Julia programming languages
- Data science libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and XGBoost
- Jupyter, JupyterLab, and RStudio for interactive development
- Popular deep learning tools such as CUDA, cuDNN, and Intel MKL

### 2. Broad Range of Use Cases

Data Science VMs can be used for a variety of tasks including:

- Data preparation and cleaning
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Training and evaluating machine learning models
- Deep learning experiments
- Large-scale data processing using Spark or Hadoop

# Deploying Data Science VMs in Azure Using the Azure CLI

Azure Data Science Virtual Machines (DSVMs) can be deployed quickly and efficiently using the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI). The Azure CLI provides a flexible and powerful way to create VMs with various configurations including different SKU sizes, operating systems, and resource settings.

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through multiple examples of deploying DSVMs using Azure CLI.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Azure CLI from [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
2. Login to Azure using `az login`.
3. Make sure you have a resource group ready. If not, create one with:
   ```bash
   az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location eastus
   ```

## General Syntax for Deploying DSVMs

The basic command to deploy a DSVM using the Azure CLI is:
```bash
az vm create --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <VMName> --image <ImageURN> --size <VMSize> --admin-username <AdminUser> --generate-ssh-keys
```

### Image URNs

The DSVMs are available under several different images in Azure. Below are some of the most commonly used ones:

- **Ubuntu DSVM**: `microsoft-dsvm:ubuntu-2004:2004-gen2:latest`

## Example 1: Deploying an Ubuntu DSVM (Standard_DS3_v2 SKU)

This command creates an Ubuntu-based Data Science VM using the Standard_DS3_v2 size, which is suitable for general-purpose data science workloads.

```bash
az vm create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyUbuntuDSVM --image microsoft-dsvm:ubuntu-2004:2004-gen2:latest --size Standard_DS3_v2 --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys
```

## Example 3: Deploying a GPU-Enabled DSVM (NC6_Promo)

If you need GPU capabilities for deep learning, you can use the `Standard_NC6_Promo` SKU, which offers an NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU.

```bash
az vm create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyGPUDSVM --image microsoft-dsvm:ubuntu-2004:2004-gen2:latest --size Standard_NC6_Promo --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys
```

## Conclusion

Azure CLI provides a powerful toolset to quickly deploy Data Science VMs on Azure. Whether you need a basic VM for general data science tasks, or a GPU-enabled instance for deep learning workloads, the CLI allows for flexible and customizable deployments.
